🌊 Aegis-Flow: Sovereign AI for Autonomous Disaster Response 🛡️
Aegis-Flow is a high-throughput, self-healing AI ecosystem designed for real-time flood prediction and autonomous crisis management in urban environments like Prayagraj.

🚀 The Architecture (2nd Sem Flex)
This project is built on 4 core engineering pillars:

1️⃣ High-Speed Ingestion Layer ⚡
AsyncIO Engine: Capable of handling 100,000+ pings/sec from a massive IoT sensor network.
Strict Schema Validation: Using Pydantic to ensure zero data corruption at entry points.
2️⃣ Guardian Validation Engine (Data Integrity) 🛡️
Statistical Robustness: Real-time anomaly detection using Vectorized Standard Deviation to flag "Frozen" or "Drunken" sensors.
Columnar Storage: Optimized for query speed (<0.01s) using DuckDB & Parquet partitions.
3️⃣ Self-Healing & Fallback Brain 🧠
Hybrid Intelligence: Automatic switch from GPT-4o (Cloud) to Llama-3-8B (Local Edge) during network downtime.
Agentic Recovery: A multi-agent swarm that uses Historical Trends + News APIs to simulate data during sensor failures.
4️⃣ Command Center (Explainable AI) 📱
Visual Verification: Automated Drone Agent deployment for live visual confirmation.
Human-in-the-loop: A dedicated DM (District Magistrate) dashboard with Reasoning Summaries (XAI) for final evacuation triggers.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages: Python (AsyncIO, Multiprocessing)
AI/LLMs: OpenAI GPT-4o, Meta Llama-3 (Local via Ollama)
Data: Pandas, DuckDB, Parquet, Pydantic
Agents: LangGraph / CrewAI Logic
UI: Streamlit (Cyberpunk/Dark Mode Dashboard)
📂 Project Status: [Building in Stealth Mode 🛠️]
Currently completing Phase 4: Agentic Swarm & Command Center Integration. Full source code release scheduled after the final deployment phase.

🧐 Why Aegis-Flow?
Because in disaster management, "Oops, my model failed" is not an option. We build for Resilience, Transparency, and Speed.
